Getting an Account
==================

In order to get valid user credentials a user needs either a certificate from a trusted federation, such as Fed4FIRE, or from the FUSECO Playground.

To get credentials from the FUSECO Playground::

  1. Visit https://fuseco.fokus.fraunhofer.de and choose "Registration"
  2. Fill out the form to register
  3. Once you are signed in, click on you name in the upper right corner and choose "Download Certificate"
  4. Enter a passphrase for a "New Keypair with Certificate" and click on "Generate"
  5. Copy the content from the resulting text field and save it as "mycredentials.pem"

Getting an Account
==================

In order to access the FUSECO Playground, a user has currently main two possibilities.

Access via plain SSH 
--------------------

This is a manual process and a mail should be sent to `info@fuseco-playground.org <mailto:info@fuseco-playground.org>`_.

Access via SFA
--------------

A user needs either a X.509 certificate from a trusted federation, such as Fed4FIRE, or from the FUSECO Playground:

To get credentials from the FUSECO Playground::

  1. Visit https://fuseco.fokus.fraunhofer.de and choose "Registration"
  2. Fill out the form to register
  3. Once you are signed in, click on you name in the upper right corner and choose "Download Certificate"
  4. Enter a passphrase for a "New Keypair with Certificate" and click on "Generate"
  5. Copy the content from the resulting text field and save it as "mycredentials.pem"

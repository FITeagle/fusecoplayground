Welcome to FUSECO Playground's documentation!
=============================================

This documentation describes how the FUSECO Playground can be accessed through its
different interfaces.
The focus lies on the users, not on technologies.
Therefore, the documentation should allow users first to be able to access resources the most simple way.
Then, different other access technologies are being described (such as 
`FIRE <http://fed4fire.eu>`_/`GENI <http://geni.net>`_, 
`FI-PPP <http://xipi.eu>`_ or 
`EIT <http://testbeds.eu>`_ API's).

The FUSECO Playground
=====================

Introduction
------------

FUSECO playground offers a unique, independent and open testbed for research and prototype development in multi-access network environments (WLAN/2G/3G/4G-LTE), sensor networks, SDN/OpenFlow&NFV cloud environments. 
It has to be considered as a testbed and not a production environment, in terms of scalability. Some resources require exclusive reservation only e.g. no parallel wireless experiments. 
The FUSECO terms and conditions are available `online <http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/fokus_testbeds/fuseco_playground/_files/FUSECO_Playground_Terms_and_Conditions.pdf>`_.
